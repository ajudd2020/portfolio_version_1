# Welcome to my portfolio! 

Welcome to my portolio! I aimed to keep it simple to highlight the functionality of the elements included. I used Media Queries to make this page responsive, focusing on a mobile-first approach to design. Incorporating bootstrap gives the page a clean look, and the use of CSS flex-box keeps everything in line. I also sprinkled in a little JavaScript to give the page a fun, dynamic feel.


This page, like my coding abilities, is a work in progress. As I learn new skills, I work to incorporate them into my portfolio.
